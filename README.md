# Cotton Plant Disease Detector

Welcome to the Cotton Plant Disease Detector project repository! This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to classify cotton plant diseases based on images of cotton plant leaves. The project includes a deep convolutional neural network model with an impressive accuracy of 97%. Additionally, I have developed a web application with both a user-friendly frontend and a robust API to showcase the model's capabilities.


## Overview

Cotton farming is a vital part of our agricultural industry, and diseases can significantly impact crop yield. Early detection and treatment of these diseases are crucial to maintaining a healthy cotton crop. This project aims to assist farmers and researchers by providing a reliable tool for identifying common cotton plant diseases.
## Model Details

A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of cotton plant leaf images, achieving an accuracy of 97%. The model is capable of classifying cotton plant leaves into six distinct categories:

1. Healthy
2. Disease: Aphids
3. Disease: Army Worm
4. Disease: Bacterial Blight
5. Disease: Powdery Mildew
6. Disease: Target Spot
